# OcéEns

EPF's teaching evaluation platform: surveys are created per program, students answer them,
and the answers are exported, visualised and summarised.

## Language boundary

The documentation, the code identifiers and the issues are in **English**. The **product**
is in French: the rendered pages, the survey questions, the seeded demo content and the
messages shown to a user stay in French, as do the code comments and log messages already
written in it. Quote a French label as-is rather than translating it in passing — a
translated label no longer matches what is on screen.

The code already names the domain in English; these are the same things under two names:

| In the product (French) | In the code and the docs (English) |
|---|---|
| sondage | survey (`Survey`) |
| synthèse | summary (`Summary`) |
| filière | program (`Program`, role scope) |
| animateur | facilitator |
| direction de campus | campus manager |
| responsable de programme | program manager |
| enseignant | teacher |
| verbatim | verbatim (unchanged) |

## Vocabulary

### Authentication

**Dev sign-in** (`AUTH_MODE=dev`):
Sign-in with no identity provider: you pick a user's mail address and are signed in as
them, with no proof of identity. It exists only when `AUTH_MODE=dev` and must never be
used in production.
_Avoid_: impersonation, spoofing, fake login

**Single-role user**:
A seeded user holding exactly one scoped role — `facilitator:<code>`,
`program_manager:<code>` or `campus_manager:<campus>` — and no other. They exist so that a
role's screens and its scope can be exercised through the dev sign-in: the other seeded
users either combine `admin` with a business role or hold no role at all. They are part of
the demo dataset, so they are seeded on an empty database only: a scoped role is a real
permission over a real program, not something to grant to a database already in service.
_Avoid_: test user, fake user (they are demo data, not fixtures)
